# Predictive Linguistics WebBot

**A multi-agent, cross-platform workflow for detecting, tracking, and synthesizing emergent metaphors, archetypes, and “future leaks” in social and news media—built in the spirit of Clif High’s predictive linguistics.**

---

## 🌐 Overview

Predictive Linguistics WebBot is an open-source automation project that harvests and analyzes linguistic signals from multiple platforms (X/Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, news comments) to surface novel archetypes, emotional spikes, and contradictions. It leverages parallel LLM pipelines and deep synthesis for “future-leak” detection and meme evolution tracking.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Harvests data from X, Reddit, YouTube, and public news comments
- Detects metaphors, archetypes, and emerging linguistic patterns
- Cross-validates signals across platforms (delta detection)
- Synthesizes findings using local and cloud LLMs
- Outputs human/machine-friendly reports (Markdown, JSON, audio)
- (Future) Weekly digests, timeline charts, and mobile notifications
